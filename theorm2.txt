Theorem 2: (R∧T)∨(R∧S) ⊢ (T∨S)∧R
This theorem states that if (R∧T)∨(R∧S) is true, then (T∨S)∧R must also be true. This can be proven using the laws of propositional logic, specifically the distributive and associative laws.

Proof:

Assume (R∧T)∨(R∧S) is true.
Using the distributive law, we can expand the left side of the implication as (R∨(R∧S))∧(T∨(R∧S))
Using the associative law, we can rearrange the expanded form as (R∨R∧S)∧(T∨R∧S)
Since R ∧ S is false, we can simplify the expanded form as R∧(T∨R)
Using the associative law, we can rearrange the expanded form as (T∨R)∧R
(T∨R)∧R is equivalent to (T∨S)∧R, by the commutative law
Therefore, (R∧T)∨(R∧S) ⊢ (T∨S)∧R is true.
Note: This proof uses the distributive, associative, and commutative laws of propositional logic.
