Theorem 3: P→S,¬P→¬Q,P∨¬R,Q∨R ⊢ S
This can be proven by using the laws of propositional logic, specifically the modus ponens, modus tollens, and disjunctive syllogism.

Proof:

Assume P→S, ¬P→¬Q, P∨¬R, and Q∨R are true.
Using the law of disjunctive syllogism, we can infer that if P∨¬R and ¬P are true, then R must be false.
Using the modus ponens, if P is true and P→S is true, then S must also be true
Using the modus tollens, if ¬P→¬Q is true and Q is false, then ¬P is true
Using the disjunctive syllogism, if P∨¬R is true and R is false, then P must be true.
Therefore, if P→S, ¬P→¬Q, P∨¬R, and Q∨R are true, then S must also be true.
Note: This proof uses the modus ponens, modus tollens and disjunctive syllogism rule of propositional logic.
