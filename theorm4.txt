Theorem 4: (¬T→R)∧¬P,¬(¬P∧T) ⊢ R∨Q
This theorem states that if (¬T→R)∧¬P, ¬(¬P∧T) are true, then R∨Q must also be true. This can be mathematically proven using the laws of propositional logic, specifically the contrapositive and De Morgan's laws.

Proof:

Assume (¬T→R)∧¬P, ¬(¬P∧T) are true.
Using the contrapositive, we can infer that if ¬R is true, then T must be false.
Using De Morgan's laws, we can infer that if ¬(¬P∧T) is true, then ¬¬P∨¬T must be true
Using De Morgan's laws again, we can infer that if ¬¬P∨¬T is true, then P∨¬T must be true
Using the associative law, we can rearrange the expanded form of P∨¬T as (P∨¬T)
Using the distributive law, we can expand the expanded form as P∨(¬T∧T)
Since ¬T∧T is false, we can simplify the expanded form as P
Using the associative law, we can rearrange the expanded form of (¬T→R)∧¬P as (¬T→R)∧P
Since T is false and ¬T is true, we can infer that R is true.
Therefore, R∨Q is true.
Note: This proof uses the contrapositive and De Morgan's laws of propositional logic.
